# Final_Project

Project Overview: A brief description of your project.

#This project is a customizable rendition of the classic Pong game. I developed pong using python and the pygame package. 
#I made the project customizable through the use of the package streamlit, where I developed a configuration file in a settings tab of the streamlit app.
#When in the settings page of the streamlit app it will give options to customize what you can customize. Examples include color of your slider, opponent's slider, 
#opponent's score, added weight to your slider, etc. The configuration file will then read these settings and apply them to the pygame file when ran. This will result # in the Pong game running with your customizations add. After that it is you vs the AI, first to 3 wins. Enjoy!

Installation and Setup Instructions: How to get your project up and running.

 #Install streamlit, pygame using 'pip install streamlit' and 'pip install pygame'. Then once those are installed you should be good to go as all the imports will be 
 #able to run with those packages installed. Make sure you install these packages in your terminal. After installing the packages, run app.py. It should result in a 
 #message telling you to run streamlit in your terminal. You will then open your terminal and run app.py, using 'streamlit run app.py' after that it should 
 #automatically take you to the welcome page, or it will show the local host link. Click on the link and you will be greeted on the welcome page. From there I have 
 #instructions. However, just to let you know the drop down tab to switch to the settings page is in the upper left hand corner of the screen. From the settings page 
 #you will adjust the settings to your heart's desire and then go to 'pong_game.py' and click run. Your settings should then appear after the welcome page of the game 
 #and then you just playagainst the AI. 
 
Usage Guide: How to use your application, with examples if possible.


 #To use the app all you have to do is use the up and down arrow keys to move your slider up and down. The game will do the rest. So when the ball is going towards
 #the upper part of the screen and you want to get there all you have to do is hold down, or tap repeatedly, the up arrow. The same for the down arrow. 

 
Testing Procedures: Detailed instructions on how to test your application.


 #To test the application, simply keep changing the settings and play the game. Keep returning back to the local host streamlit page and change the settings 
 to your heart's desire, and then go back and rerun pong_game.py.
